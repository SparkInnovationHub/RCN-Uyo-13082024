        <p class="about-inter-sec about-p">
          In the conceptualization of RCN core values, we define what makes our
          ministry different from what others are doing. They are as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li class="about-inter-sec about-p">Intercession</li>
          <li class="about-inter-sec about-p">Discipleship</li>
          <li class="about-inter-sec about-p">Outreach</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="about-inter-sec about-p">The Book of Acts is our textbook!</p>
        <p class="about-inter-sec about-p">
          In the book of Acts, we see that revival on the day of Pentecost began
          from the throne room to the upper room by intercession (tarry in
          Jerusalem), and went from the upper room to the classroom by
          discipleship and room to room (other parts of the world) by
          outreaches. Our entry into any territory is intercession, but that's
          not only the handle that is needed for true.

      <div class="about-section-3-text-div">
        <h1 class="about-heading">Apostolic Blueprint Ministry</h1>
        <p class="about-p">
          Because of interaction with scriptures, we have concluded that Revival
          which has only the throne room and upper room (Intercession) features
          never lasts. Our major and first culture is intercession! But there is
          more! The Apostolic Church is a church of Intercessors, but they did
          not just pray, they also engaged in a lot of discipleship and
          outreaches. Acts 19 is a graphic picture of the Discipleship Approach
          used by Paul in Corinth. It says,
        </p>
        <p class="about-p">
          "And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having
          passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain
          disciples, He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye
          believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether
          there be any Holy Ghost.
        </p>
        <p class="about-p">
          And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said,
          Unto John’s baptism. Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the
          baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should
          believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.
        </p>
        <p class="about-p">
          When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord
          Jesus. And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came
          on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied. And all the men
          were about twelve.
        </p>
        <p class="about-p">
          And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of
          three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the
          kingdom of God. But when divers were hardened and believed not, but
          spake evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them,
          and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one
          Tyrannus.
        </p>
        <p class="about-p">
          And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they which
          dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.
          And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul: So that from
          his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the
          diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them."
